# What is Lynx?

> "[Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/) is the oldest web browser still in general use and active development, having started in 1992." 

> "Because Lynx does not support graphics, web bugs that track user information
 are not fetched; therefore, web pages can be read without the privacy
 concerns of graphic web browsers."

> However, Lynx does support HTTP cookies which can also be used to track user information. Lynx therefore supports cookie whitelisting and blacklisting, or alternatively cookie support can be disabled permanently.

> "As with conventional browsers, Lynx also supports browsing histories and page
caching, both of which can raise privacy concerns."
